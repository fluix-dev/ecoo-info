    <p>
    Howdy! I'm Theodore, a grade twelve student at William Lyon Mackenzie CI. Thanks to MCPT, I was able to learn how to manage a complex website, how to program, and how to write competitive programming problems. And look where that has gotten me :-)

    <h2>Christopher Trevisan</h2>
    <p>
      It is through MCPT that I have learned about competitive programming, and thus experienced many great things and met many great people. I hope through ECOO I am able to spread such experiences to others. You can find me under my "alias" ChrisT on various competitive programming sites.
